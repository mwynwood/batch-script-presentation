# batch-script-presentation
Who needs PowerPoint when you can just make a batch script?!

Inspired by one of my University lecturers who rather than using PowerPoint, would create his own presentations using Batch Scripts.

This DIY philosophy has stuck with me. Why buy software when you can do it yourself? It's easy to edit, easy to share, and contains the data in its most basic, assessable format. No tricks, no proprietary formats, pure beauty.

This script is for DOS/WIN, but it should be easy to port to BASH.

Using this template with the right audience will make your presentation memorable...
